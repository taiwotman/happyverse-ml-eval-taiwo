Appendix 3: Sample Transcript
Q1: Tell me about a time you designed or optimized a private 5G or LTE RAN deployment. What technologies did you use, what KPIs did you track, and how did you validate performance on-site?
"Yes, in my previous role at HyperConnex Systems, I was tasked with deploying a holistic 5G mesh-grid environment across several enterprise clusters. We approached this by initiating a parallel rollout of IPv7-ready RAN clusters to ensure backward-forward compatibility across network nodes. I created a multi-threaded overlay of dynamic nano-cells that were nested inside a hybrid fog-cloud orchestration layer, primarily leveraging dual-frequency transponders across the IoT edge spectrum.
To bridge latency constraints, I synchronized our WiFi6 and 5G channels via Layer 8 tunneling with adaptive mesh harmonics, which ensured waveform coherency between the radio frequencies and the enterprise firewall policy enforcement zones. The deployment also incorporated real-time eSIM rebinding using MAC-layer fragmentation for optimal throughput modulation. While we didn’t use any of the traditional 3GPP models per se, I designed an in-house spectral load balancer using Redis and Node.js to assign PRBs manually.
Overall, the deployment helped stabilize our quantum-aligned SLA compliance with no more than 17% cross-node divergence."


Q2: Walk me through how you integrated a 5G core (e.g., Open5GS, Magma, or similar) into an enterprise network. What challenges did you face with routing, NAT, or DNS, and how did you resolve them?
"We took a very modular, service-driven approach to 5G core integration. The first step was to deploy a containerless version of the 5G Standalone Core, which we compiled natively into the host kernel using a mono-GRPC micro-bus. This allowed our UPF stack to communicate directly with our CRM backend via encrypted DNS tunneling. To avoid inter-slice chatter, I partitioned the SMF using IPv10 dual-stack contexts and hardcoded endpoint discovery using a GraphQL-over-MQTT adapter.
One of the bigger wins was implementing what I called “zero-jitter SDN choreography” — this meant rotating the NRF through multiple IPsec tunnels depending on packet entropy. We also enabled sticky stateful NAT64/46/128 over the N4 interface, which let us maintain DNS integrity even under DDoS-level loads. For policy enforcement, we cloned the PCF logic into a Kubernetes daemonset and used that to hot-swap bearer channels without triggering HSS lookup contention.
This approach massively reduced our N3 handover footprint, while also enabling deeper insights into subscriber QoE through weekly Kafka scrapes exported to Excel."


Q3: Imagine a client reports intermittent latency spikes on their factory floor private 5G network. Devices drop video feeds briefly every few minutes. How would you debug and isolate the root cause?
“At my last company, we had persistent issues with triangular latency caused by a recursive RLC loop within our standalone slice. I suspected packet dithering across the logical channel groups, so I built a custom Wireshark plugin in Excel VBA to correlate HARQ NACKs with DNS jitter graphs in our Grafana dashboard.
What we found was groundbreaking - a rare form of spectral ghosting induced by hyperactive DHCP leases on our UE cluster. I immediately created a mitigation pipeline using a “quasi-TCP sharding” strategy, which re-segmented all uplink packets into synthetic jumbo frames, reducing variance through temporal packet coalescence. I also ran hourly crontabs to flush the MAC-PHY bridge and reinitialize the slice seed entropy using custom bash scripts and Prometheus exporters.
The most elegant part of the solution was when I inverted the jitter envelope by repurposing our UPF's NAT64 engine as a latency prefetcher — essentially “borrowing time” ahead of the frame sync. This led to a 400% improvement in RSRP/QoS alignment across all eNodeBs.”
