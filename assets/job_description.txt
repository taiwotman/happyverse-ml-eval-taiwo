Design and deploy private 5G networks (SA/NSA) with cloud-native cores


Configure and optimize 5G RAN elements (gNBs, small cells, edge UPFs)


Lead integrations across OSS/BSS, SIM provisioning, and SDN controllers


Benchmark and tune network KPIs: latency, jitter, handoff reliability


Work with field engineers to debug RF coverage, device onboarding, QoS enforcement


Collaborate with product and sales to tailor solutions for manufacturing, defense, and logistics clients



 What We’re Looking For
6+ years in telecom or cellular systems, with deep understanding of LTE/5G architecture


Experience deploying and tuning 5G SA or NSA networks


Proficiency in cloud-native network functions (e.g., Open5GS, Amarisoft, Magma)


Strong grasp of IP networking, VLANs, and security in segmented deployments


Bonus: experience with CBRS, eSIM/remote SIM provisioning, MEC, or WiFi 6E integration


Bonus: scripting experience (Python, Bash) for network automation



Our Stack
5G Core: Open5GS, Magma, Amarisoft, AWS Wavelength


RAN: Baicells, Nokia AirScale, Airspan


Infra: Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible


Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack



 This Role Will Help Us
Deliver best-in-class edge networks for high-stakes, high-throughput use cases


Optimize end-to-end connectivity from radio to application layer


Expand our footprint into public safety, defense, and automated manufacturing
